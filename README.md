# BizVal

The goal of this LLM Prompt Bot is to take a personal approach in interacting with small business owners in a way that was easy and comfortable for them - Email or text. 

Taking these inputs and aggregating them the LLM's heavy work was broken down into: 
- Understanding key valuation areas in any given domain
- Choosing the best methodology for a fair valuation, given an owner's objectives
- Reinforcing the facts or assumptions given as a QA loop for reviewers. 
- Providing justifications for valuation
- Giving additional questions to answer for providing a more detailed evaluation
- Providing a valuation estimate only if enough information was provided to create a confidence level in the valuation above a threshold.
